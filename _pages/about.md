Hi! I'm Faiz Ilham. I'm just another guy who has too many interest, but most of the time I like to
learn about and do things related to computer science, history, and world building. I work mainly as a software developer.

When you think about it, a blog is like a digital snapshot of our life, a memory dump of our current
"RAM" so to speak. Hence the name of this blog. Here I write just about any topic that cross my mind
or pick my interest at the moment. I also put some of my projects here. Visit the [Lab](/lab/) if you're interested.
