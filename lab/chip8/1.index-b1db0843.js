All three cycles start at birth and continue throughout life.<br/><br/>Each cycle consists of a positive and a negative period.  Physical, Emotional and Intellectual aspects are enhanced during positive periods.  Poor performance is indicated by the negative period of a cycle.<br/><br/>A critical day occurs on the crossover from the positive to the negative period or vice versa. A critical day indicates instability in a particular aspect. <br/><br/>How to Use Biorhythm: <br/><br/>1. Enter birthdate using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year.<br/><br/>2. Enter start date using 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year. The start date indicates the first day of the 32-day Biorhythm chart the program will generate.<br/><br/>3. After a period of calculation proportional to the span of time involved, the three cycle curves will be shown for a 32-day period. Each horizontal bit position represents one day in the cycle. The start day, on the left, and every seventh day are indicated by week markers. The first day of a positive or negative period is a critical day.<br/><br/>4. To advance the start date, hold key F down until the desired date is reached. To decrement the start date, hold key B down.
